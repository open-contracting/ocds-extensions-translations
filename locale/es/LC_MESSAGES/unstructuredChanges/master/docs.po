"In many procurement regimes, it is common to amend a procurement notice by "
"describing the changes in words, rather than by re-publishing the full "
"notice. This is because the process is designed for humans: it is easier for"
" a human to read a description of changes, than to calculate the difference "
"between two full notices."

"On the other hand, it is easy for a machine to calculate the difference "
"between two full notices, but difficult or impossible to interpret a "
"description of changes. There are many ways in which a change description "
"can go wrong, which a human can recover from, but which a machine cannot. "

"OCDS is designed to be read by machines. Ideally, the source system from "
"which OCDS data is exported contains the values of each field before and "
