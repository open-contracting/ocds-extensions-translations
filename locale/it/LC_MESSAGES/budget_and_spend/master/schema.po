"OCDS defers to the Fiscal Data Package to provide detailed definitions of "

"contain budget and spend data, using the same classifications and measures "
"as the OCDS file, and thereby allowing comparison between 'contract level' "
"budget allocations and spend, and allocations and spending at the level of a"
" particular budget line. When used, the fiscalBreakdownFieldMapping field "
"must contain a dereferenceable URI pointing to a [Fiscal Data Package "
"(FDP)](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/fiscal-data-package/) "
"datapackage.json file (version 1.0 or above), or a file that, when "
"decompressed, contains a datapackage.json file. The URI should include a "
"fragment identifier with the `name` value of a particular resource within "
"that file in order to identify the particular budget or spending data file "
"to which contract level budget allocations and spending measures can be "
"compared, and the particular column definitions to use. The referenced "
"resource should contain `field` or `extraField` properties with their `name`"
" property matching each of the budget/financial progress breakdown "
"`classification` or `measure` properties in the OCDS data, and at minimum "
"providing labels for these."
